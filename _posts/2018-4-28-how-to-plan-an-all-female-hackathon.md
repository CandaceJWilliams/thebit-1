For most students, including myself, it is difficult to find the time to organize a hackathon. Internships, jobs, and school eat up so much of our time and energy that it is easy to get overwhelmed when attempting to organize a big event. Thus, time management is an essential skill an organizer must learn. Not only for the better of their event, but for their own well-being.

Below are three time management tips, I learned from planning SheHacks Boston. It is these tips that helped me achieve work-life hacker balance.

##### **1. Categorize Your Life, Then Make A lot of Lists** 

Every Sunday, I sit down at a cafe or library and I revaluate my life. I start this task by categorizing each of my responsibilities. Then I make a list of tasks for each of those categories. This is helpful for many reasons, including:  

* By rewriting my list each week, I’m able to see which tasks each week aren’t getting done. If it’s on my list for 3 weeks straight, there is a problem that I need to address.
* I am able to anticipate my work week and adjust my schedule accordingly. I know what needs to get done by when so that I limit the number of surprises each week.
* For each item on my list, that I can’t move forward with I put pending. This is helpful because it keeps me aware of items that I would have otherwise forgotten about and reminds me to follow up with people. Lastly, it allows me to destress about items that are out of my control.
* Lists also allow me to reflect on, which responsibilities are taking up most of my time.

##### **2. Make Use of Every Minute** 


The second semester of my Sophomore year was insane. I had many responsibilities, but somehow I still found time to workout almost every day. How?

I worked out in the hour between one of my classes. Now I understand that not everyone wants to go to class sweaty, so my advice isn’t to work out between classes. That would be the smelly option. The other option is to make the most of every minute of your day so that you can have time for activities you enjoy. Several ways, I make the most of my time, include:

* Planning out my day the day before. This prevents me from wandering out without purpose and keeps me motivated from task to task.
* Ensuring that for one hour every day, I’m doing something that makes me happy no matter what. For example, finding time to go for a run even if it means going to class smelling like dirty socks.
* Disconnecting from social media. I’ve been pretty bad about this lately. However, I have found that I have more time when I’m not wasting it scrolling on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

##### **3. Wake Up Early** 


Waking up early isn’t for everyone, but I strongly recommend it. By waking up early, you will:
* Have so much more time in your day for the things that you enjoy, which will decrease time anxiety. Not have to wait in ridiculously long breakfast lines at Starbucks.
* Be able to enjoy the sound of the birds in the morning, which I promise is something you don’t want to miss. Get an infinite number of Instagram worthy sunrise pictures.
There are a lot more concrete tips and tricks I have for how to plan a hackathon. So, if you want more articles like this, be sure to leave a comment. Until then, I shall continue trying to refrain from scrolling endlessly on Instagram. It’s not my fault, Doug the Pug is too damn cute.
